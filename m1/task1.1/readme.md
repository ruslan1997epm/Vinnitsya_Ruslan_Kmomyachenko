I have done all items of the task and am satisfied with the result despite a few difficulties during the process of the task. 

As the result, a simple static website has been created. Git allowed us to divide the process of the website creation into subtasks thanks to the creation of branches as well as the opportunity to return to the previous snapshots' versions.

In conclusion, the branches have been united into a single one and pushed to the Github repository as the final version of the project.

Anyway, It needs to be practiced more to grasp all the features of git.

As for DevOps definition, having read a lot of sources about what is DevOps, I didn't find a specific determination or one true voice on what DevOps is 

This is movement, demeanor, and best practices that refer to a collaborative approach to make the Application Development team and the IT Operations team of an organization to seamlessly work with better communication.

It is a philosophy that combines adopting software development, automation, and programmable infrastructure deployment and maintenance.
