The most popular hypervisors are:
1. VMware
2. Microsoft Hyper-V
3. Citrix XenServer
4. Oracle VirtualBox

Hyper-V is a type 1 hypervisor that is also called a bare metal hypervisor, and runs directly on a computerâ€™s hardware. When a physical computer (a host) starts, a Hyper-V hypervisor takes control from BIOS or UEFI. Then, Hyper-V starts the management operating system, which can be Hyper-V Server, Windows, or Windows Server. Virtual machines can be started manually by user or automatically, depending on its settings.

VirtualBox is a type 2 hypervisor that is sometimes called a hosted hypervisor. A type 2 hypervisor is an application that runs on the operating system (OS) and is already installed on a host. When a physical computer starts, the operating system installed on the host loads and takes control. A user starts the hypervisor application (VirtualBox in this case) and then starts the needed virtual machines. VM hosted processes are created.

Hyper-V is always on if the host is powered on, while the VirtualBox can be started and closed by a user on demand.

The major key difference in-between VirtualBox and VMware is the software virtualization. Hence, VMware will not able to install on the existing operating system like the VirtualBox. It needs a dedicated host on top of it will install
